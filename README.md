# ARC4 Decryption Circuit
 
ARC4 decryption circuit created for the DE1-SoC FPGA board.

Created for a lab assignment in CPEN 311: Digital Systems Design 2023W1 taught by Professor [Prashant Nair](https://ece.ubc.ca/prashant-nair/), this repository contains lab code written by [Mathew Wu](https://github.com/mathewwu11).

[s_mem.v](https://github.com/mathewwu11/ARC4-Decryption-Circuit/blob/main/s_mem.v), [ct_mem.v](https://github.com/mathewwu11/ARC4-Decryption-Circuit/blob/main/ct_mem.v), and [pt_mem.v](https://github.com/mathewwu11/ARC4-Decryption-Circuit/blob/main/pt_mem.v) were generated in Quartus II via the Megafunction Wizard.

The top-level module of this project is [task5.sv](https://github.com/mathewwu11/ARC4-Decryption-Circuit/blob/main/task5.sv).
